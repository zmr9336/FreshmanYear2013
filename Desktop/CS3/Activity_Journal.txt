Python Word Frequency Project

Name: Zachary Richardson

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 20
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
-implement the standard input
-split the lines
-append the words to a new list
-print the list
-test with a basic test file including spaces, caps, and punctuation

Complete
Actual Time	00 25
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
-issue with split()
-issue with appending to the list
-issue if line was blank
-all issues fixed easily
-created a solid base for the rest of the project that will be easy to use
for the rest of the project (ex. used a list which has many methods)

===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
-use the code from the first stage
-use strip to get rid of trailing punctuation
-remove the numbers
-make words lowercase
-print the output
-test with numbers, punctuation and caps

Complete
Actual Time	00 40
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
-issue with removing punctuation because removed hyphens as well
-issue removing numbers
-issue when line was numbers and all were removed
-all issues fixed with simple checks in the code
-should be easily transfered to stage 3

===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
-create a dictionary of key,value pairs
-print the dictionary
-test with simple text first (one word file)

Complete
Actual Time	01 25
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
-issue with printing
-simple loop used to correct issue with printing
-only minor changes to print in descending order needed

===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
-make new function to sort in order
-test using same test as stage 3 to compare
-shouldn't take long since the dictionary is already made from stage 3

Complete
Actual Time	02 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
-issue in sorting by value in dictionary
-issue in sorting by key in dictionary if value was the same
-found OrderedDict which solved all of my issues
-testing all passed

===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
-make new function for printing the graph
-test with same tests as stage 3 and stage 4
-basic code reuse, but actual printing is new
-expect to take longer on this in order to print correctly

Complete
Actual Time	HH MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


===========  Stage 6  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	HH MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

Complete
Actual Time	HH MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


===========  PROJECT SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
(Replace this text with a couple of paragraphs summarizing your
experience with this project. What is too easy or too hard? What
was the most challenging technical problem you faced? How
did your estimated and actual time compare? Did your estimates
improve as you advanced to later stages? Why or why not?)
